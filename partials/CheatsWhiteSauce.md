### Ingredients

- 1 (heaped) tbsp Cornflour
- 1/2 pt Milk
- 1 tsp Butter
- (optional) Cheese

### Instructions

1. Mix the flour and a small amount of milk to a paste in a saucepan
2. Cook on a medium-high heat for a minute, before gradually adding the rest of the milk
3.  Whilst adding the milk, keep stirring to avoid burning to the pan. Some lumps will form. This is normal, keep going and it will sort itself out
4.  When the sauce achieves a glossy smooth consistency and starts gently bubbling, it is safe to turn off/ down the heat, and add a knob of butter and/or the cheese
